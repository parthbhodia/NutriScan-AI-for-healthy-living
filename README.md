# NutriScan-AI-for-healthy-living

README


This is a simple web application for scanning product barcodes using Quagga.js. 

The app uses Quagga.js to initialize the camera stream and decode barcodes. When a barcode is successfully decoded, the app redirects to a results page, passing the barcode value as a query parameter. 

## Motivation

We were inspired to create Nutri AI Scan as a solution for people who want to make informed dietary choices but struggle with identifying the nutritional content of their food. We wanted to create a tool that could analyze food and provide users with accurate and easy-to-understand information about what they were consuming.

## How to use

To use the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
3. Grant permission for the app to access your camera.
4. Point the camera at a product barcode and wait for it to be decoded.
5. The app will automatically redirect to the results page with the barcode value passed as a query parameter.

## Dependencies

This app uses the following dependencies:

- Quagga.js - for initializing the camera stream and decoding barcodes
- jQuery - for making it easier to manipulate the DOM
- Bootstrap - for basic styling
